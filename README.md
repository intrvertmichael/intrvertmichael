# Hello 🌍, my name is Michael
💻 Programmer, 🎨 Designer, 📓 Educator

```Javascript
const age = 32
const city = "New York City"
const interests = ['cycling', 'running', 'design', 'visual arts', 'learning', 'creating']

console.log(`
  I am ${age} years old and I live in ${city}.
  ${interests.map( interest => ' i love ' + interest )}.
`)
```

My love of learning and creating has manifested itself into a deep interest in computer programming, which I am aiming to turn into a career. I have previously developed skills in drawing, digital graphics, photography, video editing, animation, and 3D modeling.
