# Hello üåç, my name is Michael
### Programmer, Designer, Educator

I am 32 years old and I live in New York City. I love cycling, running, good design, visual arts, learning, and creating.

My love of learning and creating has manifested itself into a deep interest in computer programming, which I am aiming to turn into a career. I have previously developed skills in drawing, digital graphics, photography, video editing, animation, and 3D modeling.
