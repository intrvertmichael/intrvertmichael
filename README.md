# Hello 🌍, my name is Michael
Web Developer

```Javascript
const age = 32
const city = "New York City"
let interests = ['cycling', 'running', 'design', 'visual arts', 'learning', 'creating']

console.log(`
  I am ${age} years old and I live in ${city}.
  ${interests.map( interest => ' i love ' + interest )}.
`)
```

For the last 9 years, I have been an educator for the New York City Board of Education. Before that, I was traditionally educated as a Graphic Designer. After years of using programming as a creative outlet, I am ready to transition to a career in Web Development. With the guidance of a mentor, I have deepened my understanding of computer science concepts and created projects that use a wide variety of technologies such as React and Ruby on Rails to develop simple, yet effective, user experiences while fulfilling my deepest desire: to help others.
